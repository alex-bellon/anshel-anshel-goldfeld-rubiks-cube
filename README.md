# Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld Key Exchange (using the Rubik's Cube group)

This is my implementation of the [Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld Key Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshel%E2%80%93Anshel%E2%80%93Goldfeld_key_exchange) using the [Rubik's Cube group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_group). 

I made this for [UTCTF 2020](https://github.com/utisss/UTCTF-20) as part of one of my problems. 

*Right now the program does not support `2L/2R/2U/2D/2F/2B` notation, sorry :(*
